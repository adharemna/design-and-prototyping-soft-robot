# Modular Soft Robot Design & Prototyping

This repository contains documentation for the design, control system, and mechanical assembly of a modular tendon-driven soft robot. The project was developed by students at IMT Atlantique in collaboration with LS2N Robotics Lab.

The robot is inspired by biological structures like octopus arms and elephant trunks. Its structure is controlled through a system of tendons, actuated by a set of translation and torsion modules. The robot is fully 3D-printable and designed for reproducibility and customization.

## üìò Project Scope

- **Actuation**: 8 brushless motors, controlled via PWM, arranged in 4 translation and 4 torsion modules.
- **Control**: Raspberry Pi Pico (MicroPython) generates PWM signals for open-loop control.
- **Structure**: Modular mechanical design using carbon fiber and 3D-printed parts.
- **Applications**: Confined environment navigation, soft manipulation, and potential use in medical, underwater, or agricultural robotics.
